# TODO — convention that is legal but not implemented

The per-convention CONVENTION.md files
([reactor](src/conventions/reactor/CONVENTION.md),
[reactor0](src/conventions/reactor0/CONVENTION.md)) describe the bot **as it
behaves**. This file is the other half: rules that are part of a convention
and legal to play, but that the current build does not produce or decode.
Each entry is tagged with the convention(s) it applies to. Anything here is a
known gap, not a disagreement about what the convention says.

Delete an entry when it ships, and update the owning convention's
`CONVENTION.md` / `GLOSSARY.md` wording in the same commit.

## 1. `[reactor]` Trash push should read as a referential play

**Convention.** A rank clue whose every touchable identity is basic trash is
interpreted **exactly like a referential play clue**, as if the trash cards had
been touched by a colour clue: it calls the card one slot to the **left** (newer)
of a newly-touched card to play.

**Reactor0 explicitly does NOT adopt this** — its trash reveal (stable rank
priority 2) is terminal by spec: the leftmost newly touched card is marked
trash and no play is called
(`src/conventions/reactor0/interpret_clue.cpp:240-251`).

**Today (reactor).** `try_stable`'s branch 2
(`src/conventions/reactor/interpret_clue.cpp:447-468`) only intersects the
focus's `inferred` with the trash set and sets `meta.trash`. No status is
stamped and **no play is called** — the clue conveys "this is garbage" and
nothing more.

**Touchpoints.**
- The `try_stable` branch order (`interpret_clue.cpp:424-618`): trash push is
  branch 2, `ref_play` is branch 8. Making branch 2 defer to `ref_play` is the
  shape of the fix.
- `variant->touch_possibilities(kind, value)` (`:450-458`) — the loop that keeps
  Pink-Fives from being misread as a trash push. Any rewrite must preserve it.
- `bool trash_push` (`:448`) is the local flag; the name stays, since the term is
  reactor convention.

## 2. `[reactor, reactor0]` Bluffs are legal but never played or read

**Convention.** A rare reactive move in which the reacter *believes* they are
playing a card that connects with a one-away-from-playable card in the receiver's
hand, but plays a different card. It is legal so long as the receiver can tell
**after** the reaction that their target is not actually playable — they then mark
it one-away-from-playable and chuck their chop as normal.

**Today.** Neither convention initiates or decodes one. The POV-invariant
abort in reactor's finesse phase
(`src/conventions/reactor/interpret_reactive.cpp:832-846`) — mirrored by
reactor0 (`src/conventions/reactor0/interpret_reactive.cpp:248-255`) —
returns `nullopt` whenever the observer can see that the reacter's card is
*not* the required `prev_id`, which is exactly the bluff case; there is
deliberately no "try the next slot" retry.

**Touchpoints.**
- `CardStatus::BLUFFED`, `MAYBE_BLUFFED`, `F_MAYBE_BLUFFED`
  (`include/hanabi/basics/card.h:30-32`) and `FinesseKind::BLUFF`
  (`include/hanabi/basics/connection.h:20-26`) already exist but are never set.
- Decoding requires the receiver to re-derive their target's playability *after*
  the reaction — i.e. work in the reaction-resolution layer, not just a relaxed
  abort.

## 3. `[reactor0]` N-player support

Reactor0 is specified and tested for 3 players only. Games with 4+ players
fall back to reactor at game init (`src/net/commands.cpp:292-299`). Extending
it means auditing the anchor arithmetic at hand sizes 4 and 3, the colour
value table's mod behaviour, and the reacter definition when the receiver is
not the seat after the reacter.

---

## 4. `[reactor0]` Eval tuning for double-discard and lock clue shapes

Reactor0 reuses reactor's eval layer unchanged. Double-discard clues score as
ordinary discards (0 plays), reactive locks have no dedicated `get_result`
term, and blind-play clues rely on the urgent CTP being visible to
`hypo_plays`. Whether the search picks these clues often enough (or too
often) needs live-game evidence before tuning.

---

## 5. `[reactor0]` Colour mode 1 can ask the reacter to discard a known playable

The spec gates the colour play+dc mode's target walk on one condition only:
"if the target would make Bob discard a known **critical** card, target the
next leftmost playable". Implemented literally
(`src/conventions/reactor0/interpret_reactive.cpp:335-340`) — so a react slot
the reacter *knows* is playable is still eligible to be discarded, losing a
play. Reactor's equivalent loop additionally skips react slots in the
reacter's `obvious_playables`
(`src/conventions/reactor/interpret_reactive.cpp:536-537`).

Deliberately not "fixed" without a ruling: adding the guard changes which
clue the convention selects, which is a convention change, not a bug fix.
Decide whether reactor0 adopts the known-playable skip.

---

## 6. `[reactor0]` `/allplays` semantics undefined

`/allplays` is a reactor concept. Under reactor0 the `wc.all_plays` snapshot
mechanically routes colour reactions down the rank (play+play) path, but the
convention assigns it no meaning. Either define it or make `chat_allplays`
warn when the active convention is reactor0.
